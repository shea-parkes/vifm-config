A (minimal) configuration file for [vifm](https://vifm.info/).

I'm still exploring how useful Vifm is, but there are definitely a few things I'd like to adjust from the defaults.  This just tries to do the bear minimum.

To use, just clone into `~/.vifm/`

Currently has a windows flavor.

Custom key bindings provided by this config:

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--------- | :----- |
| `oo` or `oc` | Open `powershell.exe` in current directory. |
| `oe` | Open `Explorer.exe` in current directory. |
| `ov` | Open current file in vim. |
| `yp` or `yd` | Copy current directory (forward slashes). |
| `yP` or `yD` | Copy current directory (backslashes). |
| `yf` | Copy full path to current file (forward slashes). |
| `yF` | Copy full path to current file (backslashes). |
| `yn` | Copy current filename (with extension). |
| `yN` | Copy current filename (without extension). |
